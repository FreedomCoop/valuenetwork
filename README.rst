A Value Network Accounting.

We mean Accounting in a large sense.  We are developing something analogous to an ERP system for value networks.
Might call it NRP for Network Resource Planning or OCP for Open Collaborative Platform.

See [docs](https://github.com/FreedomCoop/valuenetwork/tree/master/docs) for developer installation instructions.

The valueaccounting app could be split out and used in other Django projects.
