Generate new .po files:

From the repo folder, enter the virtual env and do:

  ./manage.py makemessages --keep-pot


Then move the newly generated .po files (or the .pot file if needed) in the `locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/` folder (forget the .mo) to a Translation Platform:

- You can translate the strings alone in a local offline tool

- You can setup your own opensource Translations Server (like Pootle) in your local machine or in a hosting server to collaborate in a team.

- You can also use an online service like Transifex or alike.


When translating please read the code lines involved to really understand the context and the intended message.
To miss this point renders the tool totally unusable for that language.
If there are other languages already in place and you know them, take a look how they translated some strings.


When you have the translated .po file of a language, say `es.po` for Spanish:

- paste it in the destination folder `locale/es/LC_MESSAGES/`

- move to language destination folder: `cd locale/es/LC_MESSAGES`

- rename the old .po: `mv django.po old-es.po`

- rename the new es.po to django.po with: `mv es.po django.po`

- compile the new .mo with:
  - `msgfmt -v django.po`
  - or with: `./../../../manage.py compilemessages -l es`

- remove the old: `rm django.mo`

- rename the new: `mv messages.mo django.mo`

- move away or delete the 'old-es.po' file...


Do the same for every language and restart the server. That's it!
